Why?
It's a totally useless & pointless project!
Anyone who actually lives anywhere in western Sydney could tell you that.
To help you understand:It's like linking Sydney airport with the city with a metro going International-Domestic-Mascot-Erskineville & nothing else.#cityfail pic.twitter.com/izk0QKtg4j

That's really cool!
My concern, though, that being around Badgerys Creek it will have to be closed down as part of birdstrike safety regulations for the new western Sydney airport.

The western Sydney airport won't mean jobs for the disabled @PennySharpemlc .#aviation doesn't even offer equal opportunities for WOMEN! Only 3% of the Australian workforce are female!Why does @NSWLabOpp support #inequality ?@Trish4BlueMtns @JodiMcKayMP pic.twitter.com/z9ghORryyc
The 'childish mine's bigger than yours'.Reminds one of the wankfest surrounding the western Sydney airport & pollies like @AlanTudgeMP @AlboMP @ScottMorrisonMP & @stuartayresmp .#auspol #ScottyfromMarketing #wankers  https://twitter.com/NeilSpurrier/status/1227885167265681408¬†‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/o77tJLhmGJ
Building the western Sydney airport will cause more harm than good.

They're claiming that dairy's 'small'!If you can afford a ROTORLACTOR,& have the capacity to export,you're NOT 'small'.
It's why the so-called 'agribusiness hub' planned for the western Sydney airport is NOTHING about locals & EVERYTHING about 2 industry GIANTS.#Corruption pic.twitter.com/1GAsuCZZUv
More media outlets do that than not regarding the western Sydney airport.Most just regurgitated the government's press release about an airport 'experience,even though it was so absurd it saw @ScottMorrisonMP mocked on Twitter.Only @danielsutton10 told it as it is.#TruthMatters pic.twitter.com/TaipiLCLQs
@markdreyfusQCMP the people of western Sydney have a #righttoknow . We've had nothing but #LiesLiesAndMoreLies ,exageration & misinformation in regard to the western Sydney airport.On TV pollies always say 'thousands of jobs',but they never say there's no curfew.ü§î #TruthMatters pic.twitter.com/q1t2vDmCbY

You can't approve an airport WITHOUT FLIGHT PATHS!
So either the approval was ILLEGAL or they're being INTENTIONALLY KEPT SECRET!
