You might be able to live here someday. But probably not.
Actually Western Sydney airport is a 24hr airport with no flight caps!
Western Sydney Airport is a toxic environment and life destroying white elephant that will cost The Australian taxpayer for generations to come! #auspol
Western Sydney Airport = 24hr incessant noise..toxic pollution..huge negative impacts on health & the environment! We deserve better! @WestSydCity @flyWSA #health #auspol #ClimateCrisis
So how about the extra 3million that will live under the flight paths of the 24hr western Sydney Airport by the time it opens! It’s just math!
Because Sydney needs a 24hr Airport the government has stated on numerous occasions that Western Sydney needs to be 24hrs to be viable...Sydney Airport authority got first dibs on running Western Sydney But said no because it was a bad economic plan
The proposed Western Sydney Airport is a 24hr Airport stated numerous times on all government levels do so homework it’s embarrassing for you!!
So anyone living near Sydney Airport deserves a curfew & flight caps because of the negative impacts of 24hr noise..BUT the residents of Western Sydney don’t deserve the same? Is our health not as important? @LiberalAus #Discrimination
Unfortunately most will suffer under 24hr aircraft noise and pollution if the toxic Western Sydney Airport goes ahead...so a walk in the park or picnic not so good for your health then! #auspol #health
Maybe stop wasting taxpayer $$$ on the proposed Western Sydney Airport...it’s quite obvious that a 2nd Airport isn’t needed and never was...@ScottMorrisonMP @LiberalAus @flyWSA #auspol #Australia
When you have to bribe airlines with taxpayer bailout money to even consider moving to the proposed Western Sydney Airport it tells you what a waste of money it really is! Pathetic! #auspol #nswpol
@NSWLabor do you support the NSW Government wasting more money on bribing Virgin Aus with bail out money but only if they move to Western Sydney Airport? The un needed 2nd airport that is already set to cost the taxpayers billions! #auspol #nswpol
Lower Blue Mts hammered by aircraft noise tonight...If this is the noise we are already subjected too coming out of KSA...the proposed Western Sydney Airport will be 10times worse...and 24hrs a day! #auspol #ChristmasDay
Western Sydney Airport...No curfew..No sleep...NO THANKS! #Australia #auspol2019 #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/us40U2uQfy
This is what will happen to Western Sydney Airport as the government can’t pay for it...sold off to overseas investors...So Residents will suffer all the pain but none of the gain!  https://twitter.com/araluenvalley/status/1198883053331861505 …
Independent noise study shows noise from the 24hr Western Sydney Airport will be 4 times louder than what was predicted in the EIS! #noise #pollution #auspol  https://www.facebook.com/groups/rawsa/permalink/2487057208246483?sfns=mo …
@AlanTudgeMP why are you putting another pro Airport member on the Forum For Western Sydney Airport when you refused to include the Federal member for Macquarie @stemplemanmp...seems a bit stacked with Airport supporters! #auspol #unfair
@AlboMP will you stand up & ask for the flight paths for the proposed 24hr Western Sydney Airport to be released..Do @AustralianLabor even care about the residents of Western Sydney? #auspol #righttoknow #truth
How will the proposed 24hr Western Sydney Airport be paid for?? The Australian people have a #rightoknow will it be sold off to overseas interests?? @ScottMorrisonMP @LiberalAus @AustralianLabor
The cost of the proposed Western Sydney Airport has already risen from $400 million to $1.8 billion...where is the money coming from @ScottMorrisonMP @LiberalAus @GladysB who will u sell it off to..to get it built! #truth #Facts #auspol
