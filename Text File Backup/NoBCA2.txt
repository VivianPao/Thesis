There will be in excess of 300,000 people affected (Blue Mountains,Penrith,Campbelltown,Liverpool,Wollondilly Shire,the Hawkesbury,Hills Shire),predicted to rise to 3 million by  http://2046.So ,by your maths,Sydney airport should be 24/7 & western Sydney have a curfew!  pic.twitter.com/Z9YEDog8yR
Meaning that none of the inflated predictions about demand & jobs for the western Sydney airport will even come close to being met!#investing #Airport #JobSaver #westernsydney #ausbiz @BusinessNSW @westparkcity @WestSydCity @WSLDialogue @stemplemanmp @PVCUnions @unionsnsw  https://twitter.com/rutherdan/status/1255125693668577281 … pic.twitter.com/sCVNG8BYvd
No-one wanted to touch #VirginAustralia either.Except state governments.NSW tried bribing them to locate at western Sydney airport.They went into administration instead.They know it's location makes it uneconomic.#ausbiz #NoBailOut #SavePeopleNotPlanes #westernsydney #investing pic.twitter.com/eR0D3IEaev
The NSW government tried to bribe #VirginAustralia into basing themselves at the western Sydney airport.If they have all these funds to throw away,why don't they invest in public schools & help overcome the disadvantage experienced by so many kids?Would you #SavePeopleNotPlanes ? pic.twitter.com/4eaQ9UVpdt
A prelude to the future of the western Sydney airport.

The western Sydney airport will replicate this #pollution .
It isn't worth it.
Even if every fantasy on offer came true.

Is this what we'll get from the western Sydney airport? Highly likely, since there's a Mountain range only a couple of minutes flying away. They'll be doing that #pollution belching high acceleration right over Warragamba dam - SYDNEY'S WATER SUPPLY!!! #drinkingwater #nswpol https://twitter.com/BackOffHeathrow/status/644622624891478017 …
What will be done to cope with increased emergencies and hospital admissions when the western Sydney airport creates a permanent #pollution  scenario like this one?

As far as we can tell,the only media outlet informing the public on the western Sydney airport 'without the gov spin' is the @bmgazette ! (& once by @danielsutton10 ).
All we get is #LiesLiesAndMoreLies .

'Embarrassing facts' - like the fact that the western Sydney airport will wreck people's lives,so the gov (in LEAGUE with the #media ) is concealing the flight paths! #righttoknow #TruthHurts #auspol2019 @ScottMorrisonMP @AlboMP @MehreenFaruqi @stemplemanmp @Trish4BlueMtns https://twitter.com/MurdochCadell/status/1185883483672965127 …
These planes over the Blue Mountains were at ~16,000 feet,producing 50-60dB.
The western Sydney airport EIS predicted the same noise levels,except their planes would only be at 5,000 feet!
So,either they are overly optimistic,or,as we suspect,
LYING!

Western Sydney airport - it is ALSO not a 'done deal'!

Even #TrueBelievers should see that,in regard to the western Sydney airport,Albo's attitude is wrong.Why should residents future be determined by someone from the other end of town,when the local Labor MPs,both State & Federal,councillors,unions & community groups oppose it?  pic.twitter.com/m5qwIVBa8u
Again,the point about #lessflying & #nowesternsydneyairport ....
In this case(western Sydney airport),not only an estimated 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions pa,& the other toxic stuff ('cause they don't have emission controls),but put it next to Sydney's water supply.🙄  pic.twitter.com/1DPqoAyfif
Residents in the east will certainly care when the Sydney airport curfew is lifted by stealth - 24/7 western Sydney airport planes flying overhead all night.
@ScottMorrisonMP @JoshFrydenberg tell your mates in FOWSA to TELL US THE FLIGHT PATHS! @abc730 @4corners @stemplemanmp https://twitter.com/CranfordReside1/status/1147919340072816640 …
