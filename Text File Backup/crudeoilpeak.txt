If #Sydney Airport needs more money to survive then why are Federal @InfraAust and #NSW governments @NSWDPIE_Water still continue with the new Western Sydney airport and associated infrastructure? Can't they connect the #coronavirus dots?

@Jhayne93 @IanVerrender @AlanKohler A big deficit but @JoshFrydenberg and @MathiasCormann still wasting money for Western #Sydney airport. https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2020/07/04/what-if-aviation-doesnt-recover-from-covid-19 …
@ScottMorrisonMP and @GladysB should stop wasting money for the Western #Sydney Airport. These forecasts were fantasy even before the #coronavirus hit pic.twitter.com/PWBod1oyaA
@AshleighRaper No doubt the #NSW2020 government will continue with projects which make no sense, increase debt and will have little financial return if any, just to keep the construction industry going: Western Sydney Airport, road tunnels, relocation of Powerhouse museum etc.
Thanks for the graph. Closer to home, parts of Sydney's West will become unliveable. Yet, @GladysB  invests in infrastructure to serve the Western #Sydney Airport financed by an equally climate ignorant federal government. It is clear governments cannot think logically

These AO luminaries like Mike Baird have left behind a legacy of unsustainable projects like new road tunnels and infrastructure for the Western Sydney Airport.  https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/nsw-electricity-asset-sale-to-lead-to-infrastructure-boom-but-what-projects-could-get-the-green-light/news-story/8b1ef544612ce9ad353cc3dafb00bdf4 …
@Jhayne93 The era of easy flying has come to an end. There is no need for a new Western #Sydney Airport
@AlexSmithSMH Moving a loss-making Virgin to the white elephant of Western #Sydney Airport? I warned @GladysB in February 2014: Despite growth in passenger numbers Virgin #Australia can't make money since 2009

@Dom_Perrottet Cancel all those unsustainable projects: new road tunnels, Western Sydney Airport infrastructure, metros requiring apartment towers around stations. There will be no snap-back of economy after x months. Focus on import substitution and localizing manufacturing.
@Dom_Perrottet Stop wasting money for infrastructure around the Western #Sydney Airport. The EIS was based on a fantasy projection of air traffic pic.twitter.com/eqdfpPPXWR
@NassimKhadem we see the end of #globalization. It's doubtful whether many airlines can be res-started again. Flightradar24 in #Australia and #Sydney 25 Mar 2020 @AndrewConstance @dom_perrottet @GladysB take note and stop western sydney airport works #badgeryscreek pic.twitter.com/moCC77stlq
@JoshFrydenberg should stop financing the Western #Sydney Airport which will never survive peak oil and global warming anyway and use the funds to bail out and/or re-nationalize Qantas. #coronavirus #theworld My latest post: it's all like peak oil

Building the Western #Sydney airport #Badgeryscreek will NOT reduce #CO2 emissions @GladysB pic.twitter.com/bLtj774aZV
Low oil prices mean that US shale oil will peak earlier, triggering another oil crisis. You just can't make a proper risk analysis incl. 50 degrees temps. This Western #Sydney airport will be a financial loss just like Lane Cove Tunnel, X City Tunnel, Clem 7,  AirportLink to BNE pic.twitter.com/LbcfxILser
The flight paths for the Western #Sydney Airport #badgeryscreek #secondairport #Sydneysfuture will be given by the smoke screens from #bushfires and the tarmac take off temperatures in 2026. @lpoolcouncil @BlumtsCtyCncl Provided there is enough jet fuel
@frankelly08 National security is internally compromised by building more oil dependent infrastructure like highways, toll-ways and Western Sydney Airport @flyWSA pic.twitter.com/agblirVpua
The Western Sydney airport assumes that Asian air travel will endlessly grow over many decades. But Asia's oil production has peaked while oil consumption and therefore imports have been going up and up. No one knows where in 10 years time the oil will be imported from  pic.twitter.com/dcCNxmOmWZ
@Rashidajourno Western Sydney Airport adviser Shergold was oil illiterate under Howard and still is now. Not enough oil and electricity  pic.twitter.com/aZ6v7PVlFW
