The Badgerys Creek area has a higher incidence of storms than on the coast,as well as being very prone to flooding & fog (37xmore than KSA).What would be the consequences?
Would you regard this as a safe location to site a new airport?If Sydney airport can't cope, you can just imagine what one at Badgerys Creek would be like! It takes a lot less to wreak havoc out here!

Is it because the airport is so far from the CBD like badgerys creek?Some good points Albo. I think Governments on all sides recognise the problem. Your example of Badgers creek is good.

Europe is phasing out Short haul flights which account for over 50% of flights from Sydney.
Rail should be our Past,Present & Future.
Ben Chifley was right.Factions have decided that Albo is the Labor Leader.
Albo has made it clear Labor have no Policies until the General Meeting rubber stamps what the Power Brokers decide they want.
More Coal Mining I suspect,Logging of Native Forests for Visy.
Badgerys Creek Airport,more TollwaysSuper Funds are run by Developers,Investors & Real Estate people.
Badgerys Creek Airport is another example of Super Funds wasting money.
Tollways have become a cash Cow for Super Funds but do they create long term benefits? No,just ROI
Do we need more Shopping Centres? No.Griener is happy because he loves Tollways & Badgerys Creek Airport so he is getting richer out of the Public Purse.We are consuming great Ag land to build houses with no Public Transport or Public Schools.
The madness of Badgerys Creek Airport means more roads,loss of Environment & more wasted opportunities.
I am with Kristina on this Population issue,time people listened.@robbie_buck it is Denmark.
Do we need an Airport in Badgerys Creek if we have to bail out an Airline to use it?
Seems to be a lot of Tax Money being spent to support a Polluting Industry.Yes,listening to ABC Sydney & NSW Govt wants to give Virgin Badgerys Creek Airport, how much does the Airline Industry want?
Do we need a Second Airport?
Why are we throwing Billions at a White Elephant for something so polluting as Airline Industry?Lot of Developers making money out of Badgerys Creek.
NSW Govt said the had to build the M9 Tollway because they were short $60 million in a $10 Billon project.
The Airport is a joke & we are paying for it.Yes,like Tullamarine Badgerys Creek Airport will never have a Railway,but hey the Tollway Company has that written in the Contract.
Do we need an Airport? NOOOOOOOOO  https://twitter.com/9NewsSyd/status/1234376498804592640 …Build it at Badgerys Creek,stuffing up the area with Airports & Toxic Waste Incinerators may as well throw in Nuclear Power.  https://twitter.com/JodiMcKayMP/status/1235101935423766529 …The Impact Badgerys Creek Airport will have on Transport Emissions has not been taken in to account. 
Remember the days when ALP was against this Toxic Airport especially here in Blacktown,Liverpool,Fairfield & Penrith. It meant something when Labor represented us out here. Now..The many arguments against Badgerys Creek Airport & for HS Rail have been for better long term Environmental Outcomes & reduced emissions as most Aircraft from Mascot are short haul flights which consume a lot of fuel.National Farmers & their support for Badgerys Creek Airport are part of the problem in Western Sydney.
The NFF might be something in the bush but here they are just another lousy Developer.No use talking to Albanese he is part of the problem.
For years he has supported Badgerys Creek Airport even turning Western Sydney Labor MPs who oppose to have to support it along Party Lines.FS asked me specifically where the NFF supported Land Clearing & my answer was Badgerys Creek Airport.
This Airport & the subsequent land will Clear 1000s of Hectares of Protected Cumberland Woodland so I answered the question & I got the usual Developers Spin.Moving on,I now understand that NFF is a player as a Promoter of Developers on behalf of the Liberal/National Party for Badgerys Creek Airport.
If there is a buck to be made by developers it is in SW Sydney & NFF is not a charity,it is there to lobby to make a buck.Fair enough.In the proposed flight path of Badgerys Creek Airport.
The real Road Transport hub of NSW Blacktown District.
Over 230 years of Post Colonial Agricultural History being bulldozed for Urban Sprawl.At a Function a Olympic Park when John Alexander was Minister in charge of Badgerys Creek Airport you (Fiona) who was at function announced that the Airport will be a gateway for fresh food to Asia & land had been set aside for the NFF to develop that market.We did tweet about itFiona,you support Badgerys Creek & NFF has acquired land in the area. I""ve always questioned you on why the NFF would support such an Environmentally damaging Airport & the associated Land Clearing.
Dams,Flood harvesting,Broad Acre Cropping,Forestry are all forms of Land ClearingBadgerys Creek Airport is Land Clearing,it is not Sustainable & is Prime AG Land that will never have sustainable food growing again & is supported by NFF
Forestry which you have recently advocated for is Land Clearing,Rapid Population Growth is Land Clearing.
NFF supports this.The short haul flights are a  part of the problem.
You support Badgerys Creek Airport over HS Rail.
You support Logging operations for Political Donations.
You support Tollways over Public Transport.
You support Fracking for Gas
You sat on the fence with #Adani
#AustraliaBurns https://twitter.com/billshortenmp/status/1224208494636593152 …I don't think so Ian,Airports & the Airplanes that use them are too poluting to be in an enclosed basin like Badgerys Creek.
Just open the Curfew on Mascot & use Trains to Canberra instead of jets.
HSRain Melbourne to Sydney,too easy.
Trains,yes,Planes,No.Drop Badgerys Creek Airport?No transparency in Contract between NSW Govt & Westconnex Transurban, Tolls that increase every year by 4%,Govt refusing to give details of Badgerys Creek Airport Flightpaths.The area at Badgerys Creek already has high Airpolution due to the topography of the Cumberland Basin.
The reality is Corporations have invested in a Real Estate boom in the Area using the Airport as a ponzi scheme.
We need to develop regional Areas. Trains not planes.Walkers are involved in Badgerys Creek Airport,the Inland Rail (notice we do not hear about that one anymore) Gold Coast developments,MDB Dams......Like Badgerys Creek Airport,the whole project had not even been costed let alone designed.
Also you have to pay extra if you want to connect it to the grid. NSW just sold our share in Snowy for less than the initial cost of Snowy 2.Badgerys Creek Airport will wipe out about 10,000 Flying Foxes as the proposed Development is in their Route they use daily for feeding.A good example of Large Corps destroying the Environment at the cost of Family farms is in the 1st Tweet & the destruction of the Environment with Urban Sprawl & the madness of Badgerys Creek Airport. The loss of Market Gardens & Fattening paddicks for Corporate profits.They have sold Ausgrid,must be Essential & the poles & wires in the bush.
These sucker put her back in Power & she needs the money to build Stadiums & Badgerys Creek Airport,Metro rail so she can sell them aswell.Not a fan of Albo for many reasons including his support for Badgerys Creek AirportI am far from a clever person. Glib? 
Labor dismissed my part of Australia,my MP Husic is as useless as tits on a bull. Albonese supports Badgerys Creek Airport & Westconnex Tollway & loves the Media Spotlight & Labor wastes too much effort defending his seat & is a Murdoch boy.Fun fact Blacktown highest point is 96 m above Sea Level & the view from Katoomba 850 m makes the Cumberland Basin look flat (Darug Land) to Parramatta because viewed from 60 km
Richmond is about 40 km north of Badgerys Creek which is a stupid place for an Airport.Where is Sussan Ley,Mc Cormack,little Darren Chester,Blair,McKenzie & those Nats enjoying life up on the North Coast? Lets not forget Barnaby Joyce. Too busy wasting our money on Badgerys Creek Airport & Qld Coal Mines with Developers mates.
Keep the Nats out of Western Sydney.The Sydney Basin is no longer suitable to have Airports.
Look on a Map where Badgerys Creek is. No suitable Roads,no Rail,severe Fogs occur often,upstream to major Waterways like South Creek,Nepean River & Hawkesbury with Fightpaths over Warragamba Dam & World Heritage Blue MntsWilton is now covered in Urban Sprawl (with no Public Transport) & like Badgerys Creek is fog bound during winter & Flight Paths will be directly over Warragamba Dam.
Canberra already has a under utilised International Airport just need a uprade to Rail to make it attractive.Ok,so after 40 years of cut backs to Regional Railways how many cross border #Rail Lines are there between NSW & Qld?Nationals have closed all but 1. All I here is about converting closed rail to cycling tracks & supporting the White Elephant Badgerys Creek Airport.Is my MP Stephen Bali still fighting Badgerys Creek? Seems to gone quite ATM.
With the upcoming State & Federal we need to Unite in Greater Western Sydney as bad Developments like the Airport is destroying ours & our children's Environment.Walker Corporation think Badgerys Creek Airport & Inland Rail
No Enviroment is safe.
Liberal Party donor issues legal threat to minister over sensitive wetlands development  https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-06/developer-issues-legal-threat-to-minister-over-protected-wetland/10581734 … via @ABCNewsIn the last study they found  highest cost would be from Cambelltown to Sydney,
Best Route would have main Sydney Terminal in Western Sydney that then can continue North. In 2013 Abbott sacked HSR team that had completed scoping route works to fund Badgerys Creek Airport designEven better would not build Badgerys Creek Airport & concentrate spending on Public Transport including Intra urban to Canberra & Newcastle utilising existing Airports.I meant to spell threw not through in last tweet. Then came Wagners with their Toowoomba Airport & the Inland rail bottleneck in Toowoomba. Then all of a sudden funding to Badgerys Creek was tied to the Inland Rail & here we are.The connection between Badgerys Creek Airport,Inland Railway & Wagners Political influence is a bigger story but looks like they all are no go zones.What has Badgerys Creek Airport got to do with Agriculture?
Wouldn't an Airport in a Regional Area serve it better?
Has the Gift to NFF of Prime #WesternSydney land been bought up at #Estimates
#AgChatOz #AuspolBadgerys Creek Airport is another waste of Transport Infrastructure.Sounds like a lot of kicking dirt around & not much planning.
Like Badgerys Creek Airport.Lot of dead Kangaroos now in Western Sydney as Developer & Badgerys Creek Airport clear the last of the Greenspace. Kangaroos are stopping people from making a buck. I thought Coal mines were a bigger problem than Roos,when can we start culling Miners.Sadly all Developments out in W Syd are built away from Public Transport,Badgerys Creek Airport another example of Poor PlanningSoon to be polluted by Badgerys Creek AirportNo Badgerys Creek Airport - Blue Mountains Conservation Society  http://www.bluemountains.org.au/campaign-airport.htm#.V0u2wwKsnj4.twitter … #BadgerysCreek #Lindsay #Macquarie #Macarthur@m_mobbs @nowestconnex Labor doesnt own the seat,we have Elections & the Candidate with most votes wins NO #BadgerysCreekAirport #Westconnex@cruicerod @AlboMP @Barnaby_Joyce @suemazzy1 Fund the #InlandRail & defund #BadgerysCreekAirport #nswpol #auspol #Chifley@S22Syd @nocsg Yes,we are blessed in #Blacktown (who is against #BadgerysCreekAirport ) but our State & Fed MPs are blowins who aren't local#NoAirport #badgeryscreekairport  https://twitter.com/PaulFletcherMP/status/723294472272941056 …@Wendy_Bacon Yes like the Badgerys Creek Airport, no Biz Case,reworked EIS,Private/Public Funding with no Public Transport #auspol #nswpol@arne_au @WestConnexAG @AlboMP And Badgerys Creek Airport,right?
