But what does Berejiklian Govt do? Fund and build a line to the north, servicing the Celestino site. I have called for FOI papers on these strange decisions.A mystery of the under-funding of public health services in South-West Sydney is how a mob called Celestino, chook meat producers, got approval for a private Science/Medical Park north of Badgerys Creek Airport site, with Berejiklian Govt banning public health competition nearby.No wonder Virgin has refused to base at Badgerys Creek Airport, as NSW Govt transport planning is abysmal: changing trains at St Marys at midnight to get to the Sydney CBD. Fed Govt needs to step in with infrastructure $$$ in its budget to build Badgerys-Leppington fast rail linkHow to turn an overflow airport into a White Elephant: no fast rail into Sydney from Badgerys Creek. 100min journey, changing trains at St Marys. Minister Tudge is a fool as Fed Govt hopes to sell this site, with faulty rail plan destroying the sale price  https://t.co/XFP0cZcNMkThank you Aerotropolis Minister Stuart Ayres for having the common sense to know govt must acquire the South Creek recreation zone over time, as development around new airport site proceeds. Big problem for Bringelly/Badgerys residents averted by a wise Ministerial decision.Thank you NSW Planning Dept and Minister for fixing problem at Lawson/Martin Rds, Badgerys Creek in new land use plan for Aerotropolis. Residents directly affected by airport construction now have a much better chance to get rezonings, sell up and move on with their lives.Scott Morrison wants the States to bring their population plans to COAG. In NSW that's a 100,000 pa population increase in Sydney from Lucy Turnbull's Commission, plus a 1.3 million new city surrounding Badgerys Creek Airport site. What kind of Liberal Party farce is this??Other important parts of the policy: scaling back the new city (1.3 million people) planned around Badgerys Creek Airport, concentrating on employment land instead, PLUS abolishing Lucy Turnbull's Greater Sydney Commission (an echo chamber for Big Australia immigration growth).Talking to Ben Fordham 2GB 4.35pm today, The Outsider, on NBN mess and how Turnbull Govt is repeating this mistake at Badgerys Creek Airport",{}

Billions wasted on Airport that will be a White Elephant so Govt &amp; Developers make millions. Time for a full inquiry into Badgerys Creek Airport.A question I have been asking for 6 years. Why are the Nationals &amp; NFF so concerned for an Airport in Badgerys Creek?Like Badgerys Creek Airport why do all Australians subsidise this Industry. $Billions this year alone that could have been put into Rail. If you have to fly pay for it yourself.Why is this stupid Airport tied to Inland Rail &amp; why are the Nats so supportive of Developers in Badgerys Creek?

Badgerys Creek Airport,more Tollways@YaThinkN Super Funds are run by Developers,Investors &amp; Real Estate people. Badgerys Creek Airport is another example of Super Funds wasting money.

Do we need a Second Airport? Why are we throwing Billions at a White Elephant for something so polluting as Airline Industry?@CDpay73 Lot of Developers making money out of Badgerys Creek. NSW Govt said the had to build the M9 Tollway because they were short $60 million in a $10 Billon project. The Airport is a joke &amp; we are paying for it.Yes,like Tullamarine Badgerys Creek Airport will never have a Railway,but hey the Tollway Company has that written in the Contract. Do we need an Airport? NOOOOOOOOOBuild it at Badgerys Creek,stuffing up the area with Airports &amp; Toxic Waste Incinerators may as well throw in Nuclear Power.@nellybear2167 The Impact Badgerys Creek Airport will have on Transport Emissions has not been taken in to account.  Remember the days when ALP was against this Toxic Airport especially here in Blacktown,Liverpool,Fairfield &amp; Penrith. It meant something when Labor represented us out here.

I""ve always questioned you on why the NFF would support such an Environmentally damaging Airport &amp; the associated Land Clearing.

NFF supports this.The short haul flights are a  part of the problem. You support Badgerys Creek Airport over HS Rail. You support Logging operations for Political Donations. You support Tollways over Public Transport. You support Fracking for Gas You sat on the fence with #Adani #AustraliaBurns@ianbfarquhar @JodiMcKayMP @MikeCarlton01 I don't think so Ian,Airports &amp; the Airplanes that use them are too poluting to be in an enclosed basin like Badgerys Creek.

Trains,yes,Planes,No.@JodiMcKayMP Drop Badgerys Creek Airport?@BernardKeane @BCAcomau No transparency in Contract between NSW Govt &amp; Westconnex Transurban, Tolls that increase every year by 4%,Govt refusing to give details of Badgerys Creek Airport Flightpaths.@TomSesselmann @TerryBrady2097 The area at Badgerys Creek already has high Airpolution due to the topography of the Cumberland Basin.
