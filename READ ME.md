Introduction:

There are 2 programs that work together, run using:
- main_scraping.py: Scrapes Twitter tweets, users and replies
- main_visualise.py: Processes and visualises the data into graphs

Both the data scraping and visualisation programs have 2 methods of retrieving user inputs.
- Command-line arguments: Allows quick, convenient use of the program by typing everything on 1 line.
- Guided user prompts: Slightly more user-friendly as the relevant questions are asked sequentially to get you to a final output.
